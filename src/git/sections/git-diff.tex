\textbf{git diff}\git{diff} shows differences between working directory and last commit.

\mintinline{bash}{git diff --cached} shows differences between staged changes and last commit instead.
\mintinline{bash}{--staged} is a synonym.

\textbf{git difftool} does the same using a GUI program like Meld, accepting exactly the same syntax as \mintinline{bash}{git diff ...} does.
(See also \mintinline{bash}{git mergetool}!).
To configure it, add following to \texttt{.gitconfig}:
\begin{minted}{ini}
[diff]
    tool = meld
[difftool]
    prompt = false
[difftool "meld"]
    cmd = meld "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE"
\end{minted}
