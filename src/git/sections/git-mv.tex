\textbf{git mv}\git{mv} moves files, directories, symlinks.
Since Git doesn't explicitly track file movements, this is equivalent to renaming followed by \mintinline{bash}{git rm ...} and \mintinline{bash}{git add ...}.
Useful short options:
\begin{compactenum}
\item [\texttt{-f}] forces move even if target exists (equivalent to \mintinline{bash}{--force}),
\item [\texttt{-n}] performs a dry run (equivalent to \mintinline{bash}{--dry-run}).
\end{compactenum}

On OSX, \texttt{-f} flag is mandatory when changing capitalization of file name.
