\textbf{git stash}\git{stash} stashes the changes in a dirty directory away.
It's a bit differs a bit from other Git commands as it has no short options.

\begin{minted}{bash}
# the same as 'git stash'
git stash push

# list the stash entries
git stash list

# inverse operation of 'git stash push':
# remove a single stashed state,
# apply it to the working tree.
git stash pop

# keep a single stashed state,
# apply it to the working tree.
git stash apply
\end{minted}
