\section{git pull}
\textbf{git pull} updates current local working branch  and all remote tracking branches.
It's more or less equivalent to fetch followed by a merge.

\mintinline{bash}{git pull --rebase origin master} rewrites history so any local commits occur after all new commits from the remote.
Useful to avoid merge commits.
