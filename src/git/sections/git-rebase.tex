\textbf{git rebase}\git{rebase} applies commits from current branch ahead of specified one.

\begin{minted}{bash}
# change parent of a commit: it's not a problem if it has
# many children - exactly one of them is on current branch
git rebase --onto <newparent> <oldparent>
\end{minted}

Useful short options:
\begin{compactenum}
\item [\texttt{-i}] makes a list of the commits which are about to be rebased and lets the user edit that list before rebasing (equivalent to \mintinline{bash}{--interactive}).
\end{compactenum}
