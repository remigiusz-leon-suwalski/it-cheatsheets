\section{Specifying revisions}
\begin{minted}{bash}
# @{u} refers to the upstream branch which the
# current branch is tracking, for example:
git merge @{u}
# @{upstream} means the same.
\end{minted}

\section{To be done}
To remove a commit:
\begin{minted}{bash}
git rebase --onto ~<sha>
\end{minted}

To remove a submodule:
\begin{minted}{bash}
git submodule deinit <name>
git rm <name>
git rm --cached <name>
rm -rf .git/modules/<name>
\end{minted}

To remove a tag:
\begin{minted}{bash}
git tag -d <tag>
git push <remote> :refs/tags/<tag>
\end{minted}

To undo a change:
\begin{minted}{bash}
git reset HEAD -- # unstage
git reset --mixed HEAD~ # uncommit
git checkout -- # discard
\end{minted}

% git checkout . undoes unstaged local modification
% git reset undoes staged modifications

\section{.gitignore (work in progress)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for readability.
\item A line starting with \# serves as a comment. Put a backslash ("\") in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.
\item Trailing spaces are ignored unless they are quoted with backslash ("\").
\item An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern will become included again. It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded. Git doesnâ€™t list excluded directories for performance reasons, so any patterns on contained files have no effect, no matter where they are defined. Put a backslash ("\") in front of the first "!" for patterns that begin with a literal "!", for example, "\!important!.txt".
\item The slash "/" is used as the directory separator. Separators may occur at the beginning, middle or end of the .gitignore search pattern.
\item If there is a separator at the beginning or middle (or both) of the pattern, then the pattern is relative to the directory level of the particular .gitignore file itself. Otherwise the pattern may also match at any level below the .gitignore level.
\item If there is a separator at the end of the pattern then the pattern will only match directories, otherwise the pattern can match both files and directories.
\item For example, a pattern doc/frotz/ matches doc/frotz directory, but not a/doc/frotz directory; however frotz/ matches frotz and a/frotz that is a directory (all paths are relative from the .gitignore file).
\item An asterisk "*" matches anything except a slash. The character "?" matches any one character except "/". The range notation, e.g. [a-zA-Z], can be used to match one of the characters in a range. See fnmatch(3) and the \mintinline{bash}{FNM_PATHNAME} flag for a more detailed description.
\item Two consecutive asterisks ("**") in patterns matched against full pathname may have special meaning:
\item A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories. For example, "**/foo" matches file or directory "foo" anywhere, the same as pattern "foo". "**/foo/bar" matches file or directory "bar" anywhere that is directly under directory "foo".
\item A trailing "/**" matches everything inside. For example, "abc/**" matches all files inside directory "abc", relative to the location of the .gitignore file, with infinite depth.
\item A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or more directories. For example, "a/**/b" matches "a/b", "a/x/b", "a/x/y/b" and so on.
\item Other consecutive asterisks are considered regular asterisks and will match according to the previous rules.
