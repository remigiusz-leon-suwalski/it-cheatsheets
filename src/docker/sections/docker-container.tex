\section{Manage containers}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{List containers}
List running containers:
\begin{bashcode}
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID IMAGE   COMMAND CREATED    STATUS    PORTS NAMES
fdde5a2d9731 busybox "sh"    1 hour ago Up 1 hour       silly_elion
\end{bashcode}

Useful switches include:
\begin{bashcode}
# -a == --all   lists all, not just running containers
# -q == --quiet lists only container IDs
# -s == --size  lists total file sizes
\end{bashcode}

List port mappings:
\begin{bashcode}
$ docker port static-site
# TODO
\end{bashcode}

List logs of a container that was started with the json-file or journald logging driver:
\begin{bashcode}
$ docker run --name test -d busybox sh -c \
    "while true; do $(echo date); sleep 1; done"

$ docker logs --follow --until=2s test
# --follow works like in `tail` command (same as -f)
# --until  only logs until a timestamp (like 2013-01-02T13:23:37Z)
#          or relative date (like 42m which is 42 minutes ago),
# --since  only logs since a timestamp or relative date
\end{bashcode}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Create containers}
{Create container} (don't start it yet), then start it:
\begin{bashcode}
$ docker container create hello-world
7839a444734b6825e7cf53787793724d74c100628b7db3a1c8ee7d84e94b1e4d

$ docker container rename 7839a444 fluffy-octopus

$ docker start 7839a444
# do something
$ docker stop 7839a444
# 'docker stop --time 10 ...' waits 10 seconds to wait before stopping
$ docker kill 7839a444
$ docker kill $(docker ps -q) # kills all containers
\end{bashcode}

\mintinline{bash}{docker stop} uses a SIGTERM followed by a SIGKILL if needed.
\mintinline{bash}{docker kill} sends a SIGKILL immediately.

Instead of stopping whole container, you can pause all processes within it.
Pause on Linux uses freezer cgroup; process is unaware and unable to capture that it's being suspended.
\begin{bashcode}
$ docker pause cobra
$ docker unpause cobra
\end{bashcode}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Remove containers}
Remove a stopped container:
\begin{bashcode}
$ docker rm fdde5a2d9731
\end{bashcode}

Useful switches include:
\begin{bashcode}
# -f == --force   forces the removal (uses SIGKILL).
# -v == --volumes removes associated anonymous volumes
\end{bashcode}

Remove all stopped containers:
\begin{bashcode}
$ docker container prune                        # requires API >= 1.25
$ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited) # does the same
\end{bashcode}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Run containers}
Run a container with random name (an adjective with surname of a notable scientist or hacker):
\begin{bashcode}
$ docker run hello-world # = docker container run ...
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world

# This is more or less equivalent to:
$ docker pull hello-world
$ docker start $(docker create hello-world)
\end{bashcode}

Useful switches include:
\begin{bashcode}
# --detach=true == -d runs in the background
# --interactive == -i keeps STDIN open
# --name='...'        assigns a custom name
# --rm                automatically removes the container after exit
# --tty         == -t allocaes a pseudo-TTY
\end{bashcode}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Run commands inside containers}
Execute a command inside the container:

\begin{bashcode}
$ docker exec -it ubuntu bash
\end{bashcode}

By default it's executed in the working directory that was set during container creation.
Does not work for paused containers!
Useful switches:
\begin{bashcode}
# --workdir: custom working directory inside the container.
\end{bashcode}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    
\subsection{Monitor containers}
Display running processes of a container:

\begin{bashcode}
$ docker container top bold_cerf
UID  PID   PPID  C STIME TTY   TIME     CMD
root 16433 16412 0 00:42 pts/0 00:00:00 bash
\end{bashcode}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Aliases}

\begin{bashcode}
docker container logs    = docker logs
docker container ls      = docker ps
docker container start   = docker start
docker container stop    = docker stop
docker container kill    = docker kill
docker container rm      = docker rm
docker container port    = docker port
docker container pause   = docker pause
docker container unpause = docker unpause
docker container exec    = docker exec
\end{bashcode}
