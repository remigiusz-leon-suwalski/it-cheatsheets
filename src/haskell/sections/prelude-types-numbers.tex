\textbf{Int} is a fixed-precision integer type with at least the range $-2^{29} .. 2^{29}-1$.
\textbf{Integer} represents the entire infinite range of integers.
\textbf{Word} is an unsigned integral type, with the same size as \mintinline{haskell}{Int}.

\textbf{Rational} are arbitrary-precision rational numbers, represented as a ratio of two \mintinline{haskell}{Integer} values.
\textbf{Float} (\textbf{Double}) are single-precision (double-precision) floating point numbers.
