\subsubsection{Chars and strings}
The character type \mintinline{haskell}{Char} is an enumeration whose values represent Unicode code points.
A character literal in Haskell has type Char; a string is a list of characters: \mintinline{haskell}{type String = [Char]}.

\textbf{TO BE DONE!}
To convert a Char to or from the corresponding Int value defined by Unicode, use toEnum and fromEnum from the Enum class respectively (or equivalently ord and chr).
