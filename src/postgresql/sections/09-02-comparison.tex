\subsection{Comparison}
\label{subsection_comparison}%
Comparison operators are \mintinline{sql}{<}, \mintinline{sql}{<=}, \mintinline{sql}{>}, \mintinline{sql}{>=}, \mintinline{sql}{=} (equal), \mintinline{sql}{<>} (not equal), \mintinline{sql}{!=} (alias for not equal).
For example, below query returns members who joined after the start of September 2012:
\begin{minted}[linenos,firstnumber=last]{sql}
SELECT memid FROM cd.members WHERE joindate >= '2012-09-01';
\end{minted}

See also \ref{9_9_datetime} for date/time functions and operators.
