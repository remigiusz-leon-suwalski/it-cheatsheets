\subsection{Numeric types}
There are two main types of numbers: integers and floats.
Basic arithmetical operations are denoted with \mintinline{ruby}{+}, \mintinline{ruby}{-}, \mintinline{ruby}{*}, \mintinline{ruby}{/} (division) and \mintinline{ruby}{**} (exponentiation).
Modular exponentiation of integers (but not floats!) is available as \mintinline{ruby}{.pow}, here modulus is optional.
Other common method is \mintinline{ruby}{.abs} (absolute value).

\textbf{even?} and \textbf{odd?} return true if self is an even (an odd) number, false otherwise.
